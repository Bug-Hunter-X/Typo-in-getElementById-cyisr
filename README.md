# Uncommon HTML Bug: Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur in HTML when there's a simple typo in the `getElementById` method.

The bug is in `bug.html`.  It uses a misspelled version of `getElementById`, causing the script to fail silently.

The solution is in `bugSolution.html`, correcting the typo.

This illustrates the importance of careful coding and thorough testing, even in seemingly simple tasks.
